"""Audit, clean and split the Supabase data into an `analytics` schema.

The app's own tables (`public.jobs`, `public.seeker_profiles`) are never modified. Every
cleaning decision lands as a flag or a cleaned column in `analytics`, keyed by the source
row's id, so the raw value is always one join away and the whole schema can be dropped
and rebuilt from scratch:

    python "EDA dashboard Code/prepare.py"            # rebuild everything, print the audit
    python "EDA dashboard Code/prepare.py" --dry-run  # print the audit, write nothing

What it builds:

    analytics.job_quality       one row per sourced job: cleaned columns, flags, split
    analytics.resume_quality    one row per demo resume: cleaned columns, flags, split
    analytics.jobs_clean        view: jobs joined to job_quality, minus embeddings
    analytics.resumes_clean     view: demo resumes joined to resume_quality, minus text
    analytics.audit_checks      every check run, rows affected, and the action taken
    analytics.data_dictionary   every column the views expose, with measured null rates
    analytics.split_summary     train/test counts per stratum

Scope: only `source <> 'employer'` jobs and `is_demo` resumes. Real users' resumes and
employer-posted jobs are personal or customer data and stay out of analysis entirely.

The reserved test split (20%, `split = 'test'`) is stratified -- by experience level for
jobs, by category for resumes -- and group-safe: rows whose text is byte-identical share
a split, so a duplicate can never sit on both sides. Assignment is a pure function of the
row id and text (md5 with a fixed salt), so rebuilding never reshuffles it. Exploratory
analysis and the dashboard read `split = 'train'` only.
